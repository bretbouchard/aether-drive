    "notes": "Evolving plasma field textures using physical modeling. Plasma density (0.8) controls texture richness. Plasma movement (0.7) controls evolution speed. Very high resonance (0.9) for intense harmonics. Very long resonance decay (3.5s) for singing texture. Low string tension (0.4) for instability and movement. Very low damping (0.2) for endless harmonics. LFO modulates resonance (rate 0.2, depth 0.6) for sweeping harmonics. Automation changes parameters over 64 bars for evolution. Soft velocities (63-70) for atmospheric texture. Very long notes (8 bars) for sustained pads. Creates evolving, otherworldly plasma fields.",
