Instant resonance attack (0.001s) for sharp transient. High string tension (0.7) for tight response. High damping (0.6) for quick harmonic decay. Brightness (0.75) for clarity. Body resonance (0.4) adds acoustic character. Very high velocity sensitivity (0.9) for dynamic response. High velocities (110-118) for impact. Short durations (0.3-0.4s) for percussion. Creates sharp, percussive resonant strikes.",
