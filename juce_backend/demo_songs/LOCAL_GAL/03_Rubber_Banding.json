  "performance": {
    "notes": "Maximum rubber feel creates elastic pitch modulation. Every note bends and stretches like rubber. LFO modulates rubber amount for dynamic elasticity. Velocity affects rubber - harder = more stretch. Creates bizarre, animated lead sounds.",
    "technique": "Rubber feel vector controls pitch elasticity. High rubber (0.9+) = extreme pitch bend and vibrato. LFO1 routed to rubber for modulation. Modulation matrix allows velocity to affect rubber. Combine with low bite for pure elasticity.",

    "tip": "Use monophonic mode for controlled elastic leads. Polyphonic creates chaos. Experiment with LFO rates for different stretch speeds."
