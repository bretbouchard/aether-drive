  "tips": [
    "Use exponential curve for morph automation - more dramatic in upper range",
    "The morph is most effective when preset A and preset B are very different",
    "Try morphing during breakdowns for maximum impact",
    "Combine with filter automation for even more dramatic changes",
    "The morph parameter can be controlled by MIDI CC for real-time performance"
