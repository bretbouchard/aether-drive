  "performance": {
    "notes": "Velocity controls bite and filter - harder = brighter and punchier. Aftertouch controls growl and rubber - press = more aggression and pitch bend. Pitch bend also affects rubber. Creates highly expressive, responsive lead. Soft notes = warm, gentle. Hard notes = bright, aggressive. Aftertouch adds scream.",
    "technique": "Map velocity to bite for dynamic attack. Map aftertouch to growl for real-time scream. Map pitch bend to rubber for elastic bends. These mappings make the synth feel alive and responsive to playing dynamics. Perfect for expressive solos.",
    "genre": "Progressive Rock / Jazz Fusion / Neo-Soul",
    "tip": "Use with MIDI keyboard for best results. Practice control with soft and hard playing. Use aftertouch for expressive swells. Combine with pitch bend for elastic vibrato."
