## White Room Unveils Choral: Professional-Grade Chorus Effect Plugin Powered by Schillinger-Generated Delay Lines

**March 1, 2026** - White Room is proud to announce the official launch of White Room Choral, a professional-grade chorus effect plugin that combines cutting-edge audio DSP technology with mathematical elegance to deliver pristine sound quality and unparalleled creative possibilities.

Built on the robust JUCE framework, White Room Choral features innovative Schillinger-generated delay lines that create rich, musical chorus effects with exceptional clarity and depth. The plugin offers an intuitive interface, comprehensive preset library, and advanced modulation capabilities, making it suitable for everything from subtle enhancement to creative sound design.

### Key Features

**Schillinger-Generated Delay Lines**
At the heart of White Room Choral lies a revolutionary approach to chorus effect generation. By applying mathematical principles from the Schillinger System of Musical Composition, the plugin creates delay patterns that are musically precise and harmonically rich, resulting in chorus effects that enhance rather than muddy the source material.

**Professional Sound Quality**
White Room Choral features 64-bit floating-point internal processing, supporting sample rates from 44.1kHz to 192kHz. The plugin's stereo processing capabilities ensure wide, immersive soundscapes while maintaining mono compatibility for professional broadcast standards.

**Intuitive User Interface**
Designed with workflow in mind, White Room Choral features a clean, responsive interface that scales from 100% to 200% for displays of all sizes. The plugin includes dark and light themes, comprehensive preset browser, and visual feedback for all parameters, making it easy to dial in the perfect sound.

**Comprehensive Modulation**
With multiple LFO shapes, flexible routing options, and MIDI learn capabilities, White Room Choral offers extensive modulation possibilities. Users can create anything from subtle movement to dramatic, evolving textures with ease.

**50+ Factory Presets**
White Room Choral comes with an extensive library of professionally crafted presets covering a wide range of use cases, including vocal enhancement, guitar thickening, synth pad widening, and creative sound design. Each preset is fully customizable and serves as an excellent starting point for users' own creations.

**Universal Plugin Format Support**
White Room Choral is available in VST3, AU, AAX, and CLAP formats, ensuring compatibility with all major DAWs including Ableton Live, Logic Pro, Pro Tools, Cubase, Studio One, FL Studio, Reaper, Bitwig Studio, and GarageBand. A standalone application is also included for processing audio outside a DAW.
