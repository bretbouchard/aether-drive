## Section 1: The Problem

### Headline
**Tired of Chorus Plugins That muddy Your Mix?**

### Body
Traditional chorus plugins suffer from a common problem: they add movement at the expense of clarity. Your tracks lose focus, your stereo image becomes blurry, and your carefully crafted mix turns into a wash of indistinct sound.

You've tried every chorus plugin on the market. Some are too subtle, doing nothing to enhance your source material. Others are too extreme, turning your pristine recordings into a modulated mess. Finding that sweet spot—where chorus adds depth and movement without destroying your mix—feels impossible.

**It's not you. It's the math behind the plugins.**

Most chorus plugins use simple delay lines and basic LFO shapes. They're designed by engineers who understand signal processing but don't understand music. The result? Chorus effects that feel mechanical, artificial, and musically unsophisticated.

## Section 2: The Solution

### Headline
**Meet White Room Choral: Where Math Meets Music**

### Body
White Room Choral is different. We've reimagined chorus from the ground up using principles from the Schillinger System of Musical Composition—a mathematical approach to music that creates patterns which are naturally musical and harmonically rich.

**What does this mean for your productions?**

✓ **Clarity You Can Hear**: Every modulation serves the music, enhancing your source material without washing it out
✓ **Movement You Can Feel**: From subtle shimmer to dramatic animation, full control over your sound
✓ **Professional Results**: 64-bit floating-point processing, sample rates up to 192kHz, zero latency bypass
✓ **Inspiring Workflow**: Intuitive interface, 50+ meticulously crafted presets, instant A/B comparison

**White Room Choral doesn't just add chorus. It elevates your productions.**
